# Advanced Spring Initializer (WIP)

The Advanced Spring Initializer is a powerful Spring Boot project that provides a REST API endpoint for generating complete Spring Boot projects based on a provided JSON representation of a Java object. This project automates the process of creating a Spring Boot project with the necessary services, repositories, and controllers for the specified Java object.

# Features
1. Dynamic Project Generation: The Advanced Spring Initializer dynamically generates a Spring Boot project based on the provided JSON representation of a Java object.
2. Dependency Management: The project includes a comprehensive list of common Spring Boot dependencies and handles the automatic inclusion of the required dependencies based on the provided JSON representation.
3. Service Generation: The project generates service classes that provide the business logic and handle the CRUD operations for the specified Java object.
4. Repository Generation: The project generates repository classes that handle the persistence and retrieval of the Java object using a supported data storage technology (e.g., JPA, MongoDB, etc.).
5. Controller Generation: The project generates RESTful API controllers that expose endpoints for performing CRUD operations on the Java object.
